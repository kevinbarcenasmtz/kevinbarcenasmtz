# Hi all!

## About Me

I'm Kevin Barcenas-Martinez. I'm a fourth-year student @ UT Austin where I'm majoring in Computer Science and Linguistics. As such I'm really interested in machine learning and natural language applications. 

I'd consider myself a full-stack developer who's had the privilege to work on .NET enterprise applications and React Native applications.

I have this personal website where I like to work on to display a somewhat portfolio but also blogs + miscellaneous stuff.
